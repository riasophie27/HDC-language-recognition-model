# HDC Language Recognition Model

This project implements a Hyperdimensional Computing (HDC) model for language recognition.  
It encodes text into high-dimensional binary vectors using n-grams, binding, bundling, and cyclic shifts.  
I built this project during my research internship at TUM in July 2025.

## Features
- Item memory initialization
- N-gram encoding
- Binding and bundling operations
- Language training & testing with similarity metrics

## Usage
1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/riasophie27/ria-2025-hdc-language-recognition.git
   cd ria-2025-hdc-language-recognition
